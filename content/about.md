Senior Mobile Engineer with 9+ years of experience building scalable mobile solutions for millions of users. I specialize in Android development, cross-platform solutions, and leading technical initiatives that drive product excellence. With extensive remote work experience, I've successfully collaborated with distributed teams across different time zones.

## Leadership & Impact

Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of leading both small and large teams (up to 120+ people) with exceptional turnover rates of less than 3% annually. I believe in hands-on leadershipâ€”staying technical and contributing code while guiding teams, always prioritizing people development and growth. Many developers I've mentored are now senior engineers at well-known companies.

I've built platform mobile teams from the ground up and scaled products from small applications to flagship company products.

## What I Do

- **Mobile Architecture**: Designing scalable Android applications using Kotlin and modern development practices
- **Cross-Platform Development**: Building solutions with Kotlin Multiplatform and Flutter
- **Technical Leadership**: Mentoring teams and establishing engineering best practices
- **Product Engineering**: Creating user-centric solutions that drive business outcomes
- **Technical Writing**: Sharing knowledge through tutorials, roadmaps, and conference talks

## Current Interests

I'm passionate about building products that push me out of my comfort zone and force me to discover new things. Currently, I'm researching design systems that work well with Server Driven UI using Kotlin Multiplatform. I'm in the early stages of building an SDUI engine called Mizu.
